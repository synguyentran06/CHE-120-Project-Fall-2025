    Each tiles is essentially 20x20 pixels. The floor(point.x, 20) and floor (point.y, 20)
    return a value which is an interger multples of 20 (ex: -40, -20, 0, 20, et.c) from the x and y positions of any input "point".
    When this value is divided by 20, it returned an integer (not int type, but like "math integer") which represent (x, y) position
    in the list "tiles" when represented as grid.
    On line 85, the 200 is the horizontal offset that the entire world is created in, so needed to be accounted for here.
    On line 86, the 180 is the vertical offset that the entire world is created in, so needed to be accounted here.
    Furthermore, on line 86, floor(point.y, 20) is subtracted since pixel increases in value as we go up vertically. However, the index in list "tiles"
    increases in value as we go down. Therefore, subtracting floor(point.y, 20) accounted for subtracting

    Instead of storing the index as (x, y) where x is the x-th column of the list "tiles" and y as the y-th row of the lits "tiles",
    index is stored essentially as one ordinal the list "tiles" 
    To convert (x, y) to an ordinal, we noticed that every row has 20 entries. To skip down 3 rows, we add 3*20.
    To move sideways by 4 entries, we simply add 4.
    As such the general formula to convert (x, y) to an ordinal numbers is:
    (x, y) -> x + y * (number of entries per row) where 20 is the number of entries per row
